## To Do

* [ ] should we allow short syntax `<tag/content/` in MKTScript? (so-called [Null End Tag or
  NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language#NET))

  > A Null End Tag is a special shorthand form of a tag that allows you to save a few characters in the
  > document. Instead of writing `<title>My page</title>`, you could simply write `<title/My page/` to
  > accomplish the same thing.â€”http://www.webdevout.net/articles/beware-of-xhtml#net
